### 1. Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. 
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### 2. Project Motivation
This is an Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program's project and I'm interested to explore more on AirBNB related data.

Therefore, this simple analysis is aiming to clear below interesting points pop-up about both Boston and Seattle AirBNB data we have :
1. *Any seasonality impact to AirBNB monthly total earnings from both Seattle and Boston cities ?*
2. *What type of properties are more costly and is it relatively favorable ?*
3. *Are we able to classify positive or negative comments based on customers reviews ? And, what is the distribution ?*

### 3. File Descriptions
- The data source for Seattle and Boston AirBNB data are available @ http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html 
- 3 different data files are available from each city such as
  - *Calendar : Daily price and availability data per listing ID.*
  - *Listings : Home-level information about AirBNB listings and inclusive their reviews scoring as well.*
  - *Reviews : Review-level information such as "comments".*
